Code for reproducing our dynamic MRI reconstruction experiments.

This code uses the publicly available ACDC dataset. Please download ACDC from the official source and prepare it locally.

After downloading, set the ACDC root directory in 'load_data_patient.m'

run 'sample_run.m' to reproduce the example in the paper.


If you use the ACDC dataset, please cite:
